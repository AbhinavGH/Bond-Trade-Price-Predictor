# _Real World Machine Learning Model_ 
*Aim*:

>**_Data cleaning _**

>**_Training and comparing multiple models_**

## _Project Details_ 
**Benchmark Bond Trade Price Challenge**

_Kaggle Link: [Bond Price Predictor](https://www.kaggle.com/c/benchmark-bond-trade-price-challenge)_

## _Libaries and methodology used_
1. Modules used
   - pandas
   - os
   - opendatasets
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - sklearn
   - xgboost 
     
 2. Models trained
    - Linear Regression 
    - Random Forest 
    - Gradient Boosting Machines, GBM
 3. Hyperparameter tuning has been done to get best results , along with predicting and fitting different models

# _Result_
The GBM technique gave the best results on validation set thus can be further used to make predictions on test set.
